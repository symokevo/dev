## Introduction
This directory, contains excercise files  bridging the gap between ruby and golang <br>

## Important Notes: 
- What have we learned?
We learned that we can use a local variable to store a value that we can only access from
inside the function.
- Why do we need communication?
We need communication to exchange information.
- What is a variable?
A variable is a name that you can use to store a value.
- Why do you use a variable?
You use a variable to store a value that you can use later in your code.
- How do you use a variable?
You use a variable by declaring it first, then you can assign a value to it.
- How do we pass and coordinate information in our code?
We pass and coordinate information in our code by using variables.
- What is a local variable?
A local variable is a variable that you can only access from inside the function.
- What is a global variable?
A global variable is a variable that you can access from anywhere in your code.<br>

## Instance variables
- can be accessed via a single reference and they take the format **@name** in ruby. <br>
- What have we learned?
We learned that we can pass values to other functions without having to initialize any object
using instance variables.
- Why is it useful?
It is useful because it is used to store data that is specific to an instance of a class or stores a
value that is specific to a particular object.
- What is an instance variable?
An instance variable is a variable that is associated with an instance of a class, that you can
access via a single reference.
- How do you create an instance variable in Ruby?
You can create an instance variable by using the @ sign, followed by the variable name.

## Struct
- What have we learned?
We learned that struct is a type that you can declaratively group and define data fields, which
is accessible via a single reference.
- Why is it useful?
Struct is useful because it provides a way to pass a value from within functions.
- What is a struct?
A struct is a user-defined type that is used to group together a number of variables of different
types.
- What is the equivalent of an struct in Ruby?
An instance variable.
- How do you declare a variable in Go?
You declare a variable in Go by using the keyword var.
- How do you create a struct in Go?
You can declare a struct using the struct keyword, followed by the struct name, followed by
the field name and type.
- What is a private struct in Go?
A private struct is a struct that is only visible to the package it is defined in.
- What is a struct field in Go?
A struct field is a variable that is part of a struct.
