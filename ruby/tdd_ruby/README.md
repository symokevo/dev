## Test Driven Development
This is a software development practice where test are written before the production code. The goal is clean code that works.

* The Five Steps of TDD
- Quickly add a test
- Run all tests and see the new one fail. Since there is no code yet to make the test pass, this test will fail
- Make a little change to pass the test as quickly as possible
- Run all the tests and see them all succeed
- Refactor to remove duplication.
