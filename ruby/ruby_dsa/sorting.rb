# Introduction to SORTING algorithms
a = [1, 5, 6, 6, 13, 213, 65, 7, 43, 90]
p a.sort

=begin
Bubble sort
***********
- starts from the leftmost value and keeps moving to the right
- if next value in comparison > previous value, it is replaced by a higher value and the sorting continues


Quick Sort
**********
- widely used
- uses the devide and conquer concept
- picks the pivot point and divides the array into two groups... ie
- one below the pivot point and the other above


Merge sort
**********
- uses the devide and conquer concept as well
- divides the entire collection into subsectons, sort them and remerge it with the next subsection
